This project has two activities: 
- one to get the name input from user and 
- one to pull a card name from the text file.

To run this sample:
- Run Temporal Server
- Run the OSSWorker to start the worker
- Run the OSSStartReading to start reading

The workflow starts, waits for 30 seconds, and then asks for your name. 
Enter your name in the console for the workflow to complete.
